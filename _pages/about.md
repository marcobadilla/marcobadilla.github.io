I received my Bachelor's degree in Economics (with honors) from the University of Costa Rica (UCR). This Fall 2021 I will start my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.

I am currently a Research Assistant to [Sydnee Caldwell](https://www.sydneecaldwell.com/) and Ingrid Haegele (https://www.ingridhaegele.com/).

My interests are: Labor and Public Economics, Inequality and Economics of Education.
