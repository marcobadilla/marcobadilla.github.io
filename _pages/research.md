**Reducing Wage Inequality through Gender Gaps: Good intentions and promising results, but do not force it too much.** (Revise and resubmit at journal Economia-LACEA) [(LINK)](/files/Marco_A_Badilla_Maroto.pdf) 
  
<dl><dd> This article presents a wage inequality decomposition by gender that changes the traditional focus of centering on the gender gap's determinants and the unexplained component issue to analyzing the gap based on its impact on global wage inequality. The decomposition determines the maximum relative gender wage allowed before it begins to actually increase inequality. Accordingly, a labor model is constructed to evaluate the impact of establishing restrictions on intra-occupational gender pay gaps within each company; specifically, a restriction in which the average wage of one gender cannot exceed $\alpha$ times the average wage of the other gender. For an $\alpha =2$, the model predicts a 15 to 20$\%$ wage inequality reduction, with a cost for the economy of 0.27 to 0.74$\%$ of Costa Rica's 2008 GDP. However, with a tighter restriction of $\alpha =1$, the inequality reduction dissipates, and could even reverse into a wage inequality increment. <dl><dd>
